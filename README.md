# CITS5553-Capstone-Project

## Exploratory data Analysis

To take a quick look at the data set and look for any correlations between the frequencies. 
And find two main problem of WBA dataset: Class-imbalanced and multicollinearity.

## Feature Selection

Due to the large number of frequencies in the data, I compared four feature selection techniques and chose the top 20 frequencies that had the greatest impact on the outcomes as the input variables for all subsequent models our team trained. 

## Investigate Anomaly Detection Model

In the modelling stage, I was mainly responsible for using decision trees and random forests to complete automated detection of hearing impairment based on WBA data. Original, Oversampled, SMOTE, SVM SMOTE and VAE where respectively generative data were trained and the results were compared.

## Model Explanation

As our project is health-related, we have chosen to detect anomalous random forest models with high accuracy, which is black box model. It is our responsibility as a development team to explain to the client the choice of the final model and the results, which requires explanation model.

## Additional

Since our group is working on the same github repository (https://github.com/Charana123/CITS5553-Capstone-Project) during the completion of the project, this individual repository is forking from the original group shared repository.
The parts of the original repository that I have completed are in the EDA/Jiaze Li and ML Model/Jiaze Li directories respectively.
